/**
 * First-run pair prompt (#571 / epic #419).
 *
 * When the plugin loads in a self-hosted (or third-party-hosted) Foundry
 * world that has never been linked to Crit-Fumble, the GM is offered a
 * one-tap "Link this world to CFG" dialog instead of having to dig through
 * Configure Settings. Mirrors the TaleSpire symbiote first-run pattern.
 *
 * The prompt is intentionally narrow: it fires only when ALL of these hold:
 *   1. The current Foundry user is the GM. Players can't pair — the API key
 *      is world-scoped and minted under the GM's account.
 *   2. The world is NOT cfg-hosted. A CFG-hosted Foundry container is any
 *      world served under the proxy route `/servers/foundryvtt/<id>/...` (or
 *      one that received the injected `window.__CFG_HOSTED_CONTEXT__`, #699):
 *      it is implicitly a CFG world and is treated as already-linked — auth
 *      flows through the same-origin session cookie, so no pair prompt. This
 *      holds even for worlds created via Foundry's own setup UI inside the
 *      container, which have no stored apiKey. See `getHostKind()`.
 *   3. The world has no stored CFG `apiKey` yet. A linked world stays linked.
 *   4. The GM hasn't dismissed the prompt with "Don't Show Again" before.
 *
 * The dismissed flag is world-scoped on purpose: a GM running multiple worlds
 * may want CFG in some and not others. "Link Now" clears the flag on success
 * so a future Unlink + reload re-surfaces the prompt.
