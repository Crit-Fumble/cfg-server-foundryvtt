/**
 * CFG Compendium Pull-Sync (dt#185 slice 3) — the Core→Foundry write-back for world compendium
 * packs. Sibling of actor-pull-sync.js.
 *
 * When a GM edits a mirrored entry in PlayTable, the server stamps `platformEditedAt` on that row.
 * That claim does two things: it stops the next mirror sweep from overwriting the edit with the
 * world's stale copy, and it queues the edit here. The platform never touches the live VTT — a
 * connected GM client has to carry it across.
 *
 * Each tick the elected reporter pulls the pending set, applies each entry to the live pack, and
 * reports what landed so the server can release the claim. Anything not reported stays pending for
 * the next tick, so a partial apply loses nothing.
 *
 * ── Why two apply paths ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `Document#update()` CANNOT change a document's `type`, and — verified against a live v14 world —
 * it does NOT throw when asked to: the promise resolves and the type is silently unchanged. The
 * headline use case for this feature is retooling a copied CLASS into a SUBCLASS, so an
 * update()-only implementation would appear to work while quietly discarding exactly the change
 * the GM cared about.
 *
 * So a type change is applied as delete + create with `keepId: true`, which preserves the `_id`
 * (also verified live) and therefore keeps the platform row, its slug, and any links pointing at
 * it intact. Everything else takes the cheap update() path.
 *
 * Failures are non-fatal per entry: one bad document must not strand the rest of the queue.
