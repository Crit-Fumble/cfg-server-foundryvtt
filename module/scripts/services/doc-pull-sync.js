/**
 * CFG generic document pull-sync (dt#244) — the GM-side half of platform→Foundry sync.
 *
 * The write path every entity needs, extracted from the actor sync (fp#46/fp#49) so Macro,
 * Scene, Journal and the rest are a CONFIG object rather than another 250 lines of the same
 * Foundry footguns. The server publishes a desired-state plan; this writes it and acks. The
 * platform never touches a running world.
 *
 * ── THE FOUNDRY FACTS THIS ENCODES, all measured against a real world ────────────────
 *
 *  1. `{keepId: true}` IS MANDATORY on create. Foundry's default is false and
 *     `common/abstract/document.mjs:483` does `if (!keepId) delete data._id` — without it
 *     we mint a random id, the lookup never matches, and we duplicate every document in
 *     the world every 30 seconds, forever.
 *
 *  2. `update()` CANNOT change `type`. It resolves and silently keeps the old one, so a
 *     type change must be delete + create with keepId.
 *
 *  3. EMBEDDED COLLECTIONS merge by `_id` through a parent update and are NEVER removed by
 *     it. Items, effects, journal pages, scene tokens all need explicit reconciliation.
 *
 *  4. DELETION MARKERS come from the server's `removedPaths` and are merged NESTED into the
 *     payload — never derived here by diffing the live document. Diffing `live.toObject()`
 *     asks Foundry to delete every field the platform doesn't model (`_stats`,
 *     `prototypeToken`, most of a DataModel) and the whole update becomes a SILENT no-op.
 *     Markers are also type-sensitive: they work on `flags`, throw on `Actor.img`, and are
 *     silently ignored under a DataModel-backed `system`. The SERVER decides which paths
 *     are eligible, per document type, from measurement.
 *
 *  5. `everPushed` distinguishes "not created yet" from "the GM deleted it": absent +
 *     never-pushed → create; absent + already-pushed → report `world_deleted` so the server
 *     parks the row instead of resurrecting the document on every tick.
 *
 * Single-reporter election: the human GM with the smallest id does the work; the service-GM
 * only when it is the sole connected GM. A GM is required — creating documents and setting
 * ownership are GM-only.
 *
 * All failures are non-fatal and per-document. A failed write is acked as an error, which
 * leaves the server's baseline untouched, so the document reappears in the next plan.
