# Owner Promotion (Foundry GM role) — #588

## Why this exists

When a Crit-Fumble user creates a campaign and launches FoundryVTT, they
need to land in their world as a Foundry **GAMEMASTER** (role 4). Without
this, they can't upload assets, build scenes, or manage tokens — they have
to ask a platform admin to promote them, which is a terrible first
experience for a paid tier.

The Core Auth Bypass flow (`syncFoundryUser` in
`scripts/auth/core-auth.js`) used to assign every newly-created Foundry
user the world's `defaultUserRole` (typically Player = 1), regardless of
ownership. This document is the contract for the fix.

## How owner identity flows from server to plugin

## Server contract

The Core platform writes `crit-fumble-core.ownerCoreUserId` to each world's
`settings.db` at the same time it enables the plugin. This happens on every
launch via `syncCfgPlugin(vttDataPath, ownerCoreUserId)`.

- The owner ID is the `userId` of the `UserAppInstallation` row.
- The write is idempotent — settings.db is NeDB (last-write-wins by `key`),
  and the helper no-ops when the latest entry already matches.
- If `ownerCoreUserId` is omitted (e.g. admin instance), the stamp is
  skipped and ownership-based promotion never fires for that world.

## Plugin contract

`syncFoundryUser` reads `ownerCoreUserId` once per call. The pure
`resolveFoundryRole(coreUserId, ownerCoreUserId, defaultRole)` helper
returns the role to assign:

- `coreUserId === ownerCoreUserId` (and both non-empty) → role 4 (GM)
- otherwise → `defaultRole` from world settings

Two branches use the same logic:

1. **New-user create** — pass `desiredRole` to `User.create(...)`.
2. **Existing-user update** — if the user is the owner AND their current
   role is below GM, idempotently `update({ role: 4 })`. We **never demote**
   an existing user; a manually-promoted assistant or trusted player keeps
   their access if they happen to re-auth through Core.

## Edge cases

| Situation                                        | Behavior                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-#588 world without `ownerCoreUserId` stamped | Plugin falls back to `defaultRole` for everyone. Owner can manually promote themselves until the next launch re-stamps the setting.                |
| Player auths first, owner auths later            | Player lands at `defaultRole`. Owner lands at GM. Each user is evaluated against the world's owner ID independently.                               |
| Owner already exists at GM                       | `update({ role: 4 })` no-ops; logs `Updated existing user`.                                                                                        |
| World linked to a non-standard hosting path      | Worlds outside `Data/worlds/` need a separate sweep. The pre-2026-05 `Realm → world` linkage path was removed with `CoreRealm`; the equivalent path under `CoreGameWorld` is a follow-up if/when non-standard hosting roots come back.                          |
| Admin instance                                   | `syncCfgPlugin` is not called for the admin instance (it has its own setup path); admins are GM via Foundry's native `admin.txt` flow.             |

## Tests

- `tests/unit/resolve-foundry-role.test.js` — pins the pure helper across
  all six combinations of (owner=user, owner≠user, empty owner, empty
  user, etc.).
- The full `syncFoundryUser` flow lives behind heavy Foundry globals
  (`game.users`, `User.create`); integration coverage belongs in the
  `tests/integration/` Playwright suite.

## Don't re-introduce the bug

If you touch `syncFoundryUser`, keep the role decision delegated to
`resolveFoundryRole`. Don't read `defaultRole` directly into a `User.create`
call without going through the helper — that's literally how this bug
shipped originally.
